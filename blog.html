            <h3>12th May 2020</h3>
            <h1>Venues, Venues, Venues!</h1>
            <p>I think we have chosen our favourite venues...<br><br>

                The Priest House for the Ceremony and Stirk House for the Reception.<br><br>
                
                We went for a little drive today to have a look around the outside of the venues - and completely fell in love.<br><br>
                
                We'll update again when we've seen the inside! Obviously because of lockdown, we've had to take a chance and book without seeing the inside... 
                but we get to see The Priests House on 18th June and we get to see Stirk House on 5th July - I'm sure we'll love them just as much when we see 
                the inside in person.</p><br>

            <h3>28th March 2020</h3>
            <h1>The Proposal!</h1>
            <p>It's lockdown, but you have to make the best of crappy situations.<br><br>

                Getting engaged was definitely the best way to make these grim times much more happy and exciting!<br><br>
                
                We were meant to be going on holiday in April - where Tom admits he wanted to propose - but now with lockdown, who knew when the next opportunity would be?<br><br>
                
                He came into the living room, got down on one knee and opened up a little box with the most beautiful ring. I couldn't say "Yes" quick enough.<br><br>
                
                The dogs approved.</p><br>
