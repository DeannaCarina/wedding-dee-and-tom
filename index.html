        We are getting married!<br><br>

        In your invitation pack, you would have found this website as a way to confirm your attendance - if this is what you would like to do, please 
        follow the 'confirm attendance' link at the top of this page.<br><br>

        As we wait for our big day to arrive, we have made this website as a way for us to keep you up-to-date on everything, share timings with you (see 'order 
        of the day') and to share our story with you (see 'wedding blog'). If you need to speak to us for any reason at all with regards to our big day, please 
        either message us in the usual ways (WhatsApp, Facebook, Text etc.) or use the 'contact us' link at the top of this page - this will go straight through 
        to our personal emails.<br><br>

        Enjoy the site, and see you soon, lots of love!<br><br>

        Dee and Tom<br><br>

        x x x<br><br>

        P.S The dogs will be at our wedding ceremony - if you are allergic, please take precautionary measures, if you are scared of dogs, please let us know in 
        advance so we can ensure you have a seat away from the aisle - this is the best we can do as we will not be omitting them from the ceremony. They won't be 
        there at the evening reception as there will be too much going on, too much noise for them and too many distractions for them to be good boys.<br><br>


        P.PS (well done for getting this far) our Instagram hashtag is #DeeTom2022 please upload your pictures to instagram and use the hashtag so we can see all your 
        pictures from the day
